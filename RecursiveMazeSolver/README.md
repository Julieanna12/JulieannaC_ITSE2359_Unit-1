I knew I had to do recursive backtracking so I ensured I wanted to make sure I understood how it was going to work which it moves through all possible directions and if it is blocked it backtracks and tries a different direction. If the position works it marks the cell as part of the path and returns true. If the current position is not the destination, the function marks it as part of the path, tries all possible directions, and recursively continues to search for the solution. If all directions fail, it backtracks by unmarking the current cell and returns false to try a new path from the previous position.

My main issue was ensuring that the algorithm doesn't access out of bounds array elements which would cause faults. After adding proper bound checks that wasnt a concern anymore. To avoid infinite loops I had to ensure not to revist the same cells during the search process.  
While the printMaze() function provides a visual representation of the maze, the formatting was an initial challenge. The solution path needs to be printed clearly without distorting the visual layout of the maze. If the cells are not properly spaced or aligned, the maze might look garbled, making it harder to interpret the output.
